## Lecture overview

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### Last time we learned:

- What are relational databases and why they are still dominant in data science
- How to install and run PostgreSQL and pgAdmin
- How to create databases, tables, and insert data
- How to perform queries with `SELECT`, `WHERE` and `ORDER BY`
- Group data with `GROUP BY` and filter groups with `HAVING`
- Compute statistics with `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`
- That's quite a lot! ü§ì
- [By the way, any issues with the installation?]{.alert} ü§î

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Today we will learn:

- How to connect SQL with Python, because we love Python! üêç üòÇ
- We will use the `psycopg2` and `sqlalchemy` libraries (and `pandas` too! üêº)
- We will also learn about other SQL commands, such as `LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `CASE`, window functions, and string functions like `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `LENGTH`
- How to fill missing data with `COALESCE`
- If time allows, we will also see how to pivot tables in PostgreSQL
- Let's get started! üöÄ

# Connecting SQL with Python üêç {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Why connect SQL with Python?

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- SQL is great for data manipulation and querying, but it is not a programming language
- So it is useful to connect SQL with a programming language that allows for more complex operations, data visualisation, and machine learning
- Do you know any programming language that does that? _Of course you do!_ üòÇ
- So let's see how to connect SQL with Python! üêç
- First, let's install the `psycopg2` and `sqlalchemy` libraries

```{verbatim}
pip install psycopg2 sqlalchemy

# or
# conda install psycopg2 sqlalchemy
```
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
:::{style="text-align: center;"}
[![](figures/sqlalchemy.jpg){width="60%"}](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/){data-modal-type="iframe"}
:::

- `psycopg2` is a PostgreSQL adapter for Python (more info [here](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/){data-modal-type="iframe"})
- It allows you to connect to a PostgreSQL database and execute SQL commands
- `sqlalchemy` is a SQL for Python, and it is database-agnostic
-  More information about it [here](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/){data-modal-type="iframe"}
- Both of them are very popular and work well together (and with other Python libraries too)
:::
:::
:::

## Connecting to a PostgreSQL database

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- `sqlalchemy` generates SQL statements and `psycopg2` sends SQL statements to the database
- So let's load the libraries! ü§ì

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
import psycopg2
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text
```

- Now let's connect to the database
- We need the database name, user, password, and host

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Connection parameters
engine = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres')
connection = engine.connect()
```

- Let's see what every part of the connection string means
- `create_engine()` creates a connection to the database
- `postgresql+psycopg2` is the database driver
- `postgres:postgres` is the username and password
- `localhost:5432` is the host and port
- `postgres` is the database name
:::

# SQL commands in Python üêç {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Executing SQL commands in Python

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 19px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
- Now that we have connected to the database, we can execute SQL commands
- We can use the `execute()` method of the connection object
- Let's see an example

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Create drivers table
connection.execute(text('''
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS drivers;
CREATE TABLE drivers (
    driver_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    driver_name VARCHAR(50),
    team VARCHAR(50),
    nationality VARCHAR(50),
    victories INT
);
'''))
connection.commit()
```

- The `commit()` method is necessary to save the changes, otherwise they will be lost
:::

:::{.column width="60%"}
- The `execute()` method receives a string with the SQL command
- We can use triple quotes to write multi-line strings
- Let's add some data to the table

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Add data to the drivers table
connection.execute(text('''
INSERT INTO drivers (driver_name, team, nationality, victories)
VALUES 
    ('Lewis Hamilton', 'Mercedes', 'British', 103),
    ('Max Verstappen', 'Red Bull Racing', 'Dutch', 55),
    ('Charles Leclerc', 'Ferrari', 'Mon√©gasque', 5),
    ('Fernando Alonso', 'Aston Martin', NULL, NULL)
'''))
connection.commit()
```

- Now let's check if the data were inserted correctly
- We can use the `SELECT` command for that, and `fetchall()` to retrieve the data

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('SELECT * FROM drivers')).fetchall()
```
:::
:::
:::

## `IN` and `BETWEEN` operators

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- We use `IN` to filter data based on a list of values

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE team IN ('Ferrari', 'Mercedes');
''')).fetchall()
```

- `BETWEEN` is used to filter data within a range

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE victories BETWEEN 50 AND 100;
''')).fetchall()
```

- We can also use `NOT IN` and `NOT BETWEEN` to exclude values

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE team NOT IN ('Ferrari', 'Mercedes');
''')).fetchall()
```
:::

## `LIKE`, `ILIKE`, and `SIMILAR TO` operators

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- We can use the `LIKE` operator to filter data based on patterns
- `%` is a wildcard that matches any sequence of characters
- `_` is a wildcard that matches any single character

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE driver_name LIKE 'L%';
''')).fetchall()
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE team LIKE 'M______s';
''')).fetchall()
```

- We can also use `NOT LIKE` to exclude patterns

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE driver_name NOT LIKE 'L%';
''')).fetchall()
```
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- `ILIKE` is the case-insensitive version of `LIKE`

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE driver_name ILIKE 'l%';
''')).fetchall()
```

- `SIMILAR TO` is another operator that allows for more complex patterns

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE driver_name SIMILAR TO 'L[a-z]%';
''')).fetchall()
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers
WHERE team SIMILAR TO '%(Racing|Martin)';
''')).fetchall()
```

## Try it yourself! ü§ì {#sec:exercise01}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Now it's your turn to practice!
- Find all drivers whose names start with 'M'
- Find drivers whose nationality contain exactly 7 characters
- List drivers whose names start with either 'L' or 'M'
- Find drivers who have won between 1 and 10 races

:::

# Missing data {background-color="#2d4563"}

## `IS NULL` and `COALESCE` operators

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- We can also use `IS NULL` to check for missing values

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE victories IS NULL;
''')).fetchall()
```

- We can fill missing values with `COALESCE`
- It is a simple impuation method that replaces missing values with a constant
- The syntax is `COALESCE(column_name, value)`

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT driver_name, COALESCE(victories, 30) FROM drivers;
''')).fetchall()
```
:::

## `COALESCE` with subqueries

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- We can also use `COALESCE` with subqueries
- Subqueries are used when we need to compute a value based on another query, usually for aggregation purposes
- In this example, we compute the average number of victories and use it to fill missing values (rounding to 2 decimal places)
- Note the use of `::int` to convert the result to an integer
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT 
  driver_name,
  COALESCE(victories, 
    (SELECT AVG(victories)::int
     FROM drivers 
     WHERE victories IS NOT NULL)) 
FROM drivers;
''')).fetchall()
```
::: 

# Window functions {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Window functions

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- Window functions are used to compute values based on a group of rows
- They are similar to aggregation functions, but they [do not reduce the number of rows]{.alert}
- The syntax is `function() OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column)`
- We can use `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, and many others

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
INSERT INTO drivers (driver_name, team, nationality, victories)
VALUES 
    ('Valtteri Bottas', 'Mercedes', 'Finnish', 10),
    ('Sergio Perez', 'Red Bull Racing', 'Mexican', 5),
    ('Lando Norris', 'McLaren', 'British', 2),
    ('Esteban Ocon', 'Ferrari', 'French', 1)
''')) 

connection.execute(text('''
SELECT driver_name, team, victories,
    ROUND(AVG(victories) OVER (), 2) AS avg_victories,
    ROUND(AVG(victories) OVER (PARTITION BY team), 2) AS avg_victories_team,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY victories DESC) AS rank
FROM drivers
ORDER BY victories DESC;
''')).fetchall()
```
:::

## Window functions versus `GROUP BY`

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### `GROUP BY`

- `GROUP BY` [reduces the number of rows]{.alert} in the result set
- It is used to aggregate data based on a column
- It is useful to compute statistics for groups of data, but it is not as flexible as window functions

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT team, ROUND(AVG(victories), 2) AS avg_victories
FROM drivers
GROUP BY team;
''')).fetchall()
```
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Window functions

- Window functions can have [multiple partitions]{.alert} and [orderings]{.alert}, and they are particularly useful for time series data, when we need to compute values based on a time window
- For instance, they can be used to calculate moving averages, cumulative sums, and other statistics

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT 
    driver_name, 
    team, 
    victories,
    ROUND(AVG(victories) OVER (PARTITION BY team), 2) AS avg_victories_team,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY victories DESC) AS rank,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY team ORDER BY victories DESC) AS rank_team
FROM drivers
WHERE victories IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY rank ASC;
''')).fetchall()
``` 
:::
:::
:::

## Try it yourself! ü§ì {#sec:exercise02}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Select the variables `driver_name`, `nationality`, and `victories` from the `drivers` table
- Create a column called `rank_nationality` that ranks drivers based on the number of victories and their nationality
- Drop missing values in the `victories` column
- Order the results by `rank_nationality`
- [[Appendix 02]{.button}](#sec:appendix02)
:::

# String functions {background-color="#2d4563"}

## String functions

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- SQL has several string functions that can be used to manipulate text data
- We can use `LEFT()`, `RIGHT()`, `LENGTH()`, `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, `INITCAP()`, `TRIM()`, `REPLACE()`, and many others
- They are usually very similar to their Python counterparts (and straightforward to use!)

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT driver_name, 
    LEFT(driver_name, 5) AS first_name,
    RIGHT(driver_name, 8) AS last_name,
    LENGTH(driver_name) AS name_length,
    UPPER(driver_name) AS upper_name,
    LOWER(driver_name) AS lower_name,
    INITCAP(driver_name) AS initcap_name
FROM drivers;
''')).fetchall()
```
:::

## String functions

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- We can also use `TRIM()` to remove leading and trailing spaces
- `STRPOS()` returns the position of a substring in a string
- `REPLACE()` is used to replace a substring with another substring
- `CONCAT()` concatenates strings

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT driver_name, 
    TRIM(driver_name) AS trimmed_name,
    STRPOS(driver_name, 'a') AS a_position,
    REPLACE(driver_name, ' ', '_') AS replaced_name,
    CONCAT(driver_name, ' is a great driver!') AS message
FROM drivers;
''')).fetchall()
```
:::

# CASE statement <br> (If-Then-Else) {background-color="#2d4563"}

## `CASE` statement

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 17px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- SQL does not have an `IF` statement, but we can use the `CASE` statement
- It works exactly like `if` statements in other programming languages
- The syntax is `CASE WHEN condition THEN value ELSE value END`

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT driver_name, 
    CASE 
        WHEN victories > 50 THEN 'Great driver'
        ELSE 'Good driver'
    END
FROM drivers;
''')).fetchall()
```
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- We can also use `CASE` with multiple conditions
- The `AS` keyword is used to rename the column

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT driver_name, 
    CASE 
        WHEN victories > 50 THEN 'Great driver'
        WHEN victories < 10 THEN 'Average driver'
        ELSE 'No data'
    END AS driver_status
FROM drivers;
''')).fetchall()
```

- `CASE` can be combined with `IN` and `BETWEEN` operators
- It is a very versatile statement! ü§ì

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT driver_name, 
    CASE 
        WHEN victories IN (5, 54) THEN 'Good driver'
        WHEN victories BETWEEN 55 AND 110 THEN 'Great driver'
        ELSE 'No data'
    END AS driver_status
FROM drivers;
''')).fetchall()
```
:::
:::
:::

## `CASE` for missing values

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 19px;"}
- `CASE` can also be useful to fill missing values with conditions
- Let's add some missing values to the table
  
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE victories IS NULL;
''')).fetchall()
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT driver_name, 
    CASE 
        WHEN nationality IS NULL THEN 'Spanish'
        ELSE nationality
    END,
    CASE 
        WHEN victories IS NULL THEN 30
        ELSE victories
    END
FROM drivers
''')).fetchall()
```

- Note the use of [commas to separate the columns]{.alert}
:::

## Try it yourself! ü§ì {#sec:exercise03}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Let's see if you can use the `CASE` statement
- Create a column called `driver_level` that classifies drivers as 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', or 'Expert' based on the number of victories
  - 'Beginner' if victories < 10
  - 'Intermediate' if victories between 10 and 100
  - 'Expert' if victories > 100

# Using SQL with `pandas` üêº {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Using SQL with `pandas`

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 19px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- We all know that `pandas` is great! üòé
- And it can be even better when combined with SQL queries
- We can use the `read_sql()` method to read data from a SQL query

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
import pandas as pd

# Read data from SQL query
df = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM drivers', connection)
df
```
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- You can pass any SQL query to the `read_sql()` method

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
pd.read_sql(
  "SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE victories > 50 AND nationality = 'British'", 
  connection
)
```

<br>

- Yes, it is that simple! ü§ì
- And you all now want to kill me for not showing this before! üòÇ
- Just connect to the database using `sqlalchemy` and use `read_sql()` to read the data if that's what you want
- Note the use of double quotes for the SQL query and single quotes for the strings
- SQL only accepts single quotes, so be careful with that üòâ
:::
:::
:::

## Using SQL with `pandas`

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- We can then use any `pandas` method to manipulate the data

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
df.groupby('team').agg(avg_victories=('victories', 'mean')).dropna()
```

- Using `.query()` to filter data

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
df.query('victories > 50')
```
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- We can also write data to a SQL table with the `to_sql()` method

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
df.to_sql('drivers_copy', connection, if_exists='replace', index=False)

# Check if the data were written correctly
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM drivers_copy', connection)
```
:::
:::
:::

## Try it yourself! ü§ì {#sec:exercise04}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- Create a new SQL table called `employees` with the following columns:
  - `employee_id` (serial, primary key)
  - `employee_name` (varchar(50))
  - `department` (varchar(50))
  - `salary` (int)
- Remember to drop the table if it already exists
- Insert some data into the table and read it with `pandas` (you can see the example below)
- Commit the changes
- Use `pandas` to compute the average salary by department

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# Create employees table first, then insert data
'Alice', 'HR', 5000
'Bob', 'IT', 6000
'Charlie', 'HR', 7000

# Pivot tables in SQL üìÑ {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Pivot tables in SQL

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- We have already seen how to pivot tables in `pandas`
- But we can also pivot tables in SQL too
- We can use the `CASE` function to pivot tables, which is similar to the `pivot_table()` method in `pandas`
- Let's create another table with student scores

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS student_scores;
CREATE TABLE student_scores (
    student_name VARCHAR(50),
    subject VARCHAR(50),
    score INTEGER,
    term VARCHAR(10)
);

INSERT INTO student_scores (student_name, subject, score, term)
VALUES 
    ('Alice', 'Maths', 90, 'Q1'),
    ('Alice', 'Maths', 80, 'Q2'),
    ('Alice', 'Science', 80, 'Q1'),
    ('Alice', 'Science', 75, 'Q2'),
    ('Bob', 'Maths', 80, 'Q1'),
    ('Bob', 'Maths', 100, 'Q2'),
    ('Bob', 'Science', 80, 'Q1'),
    ('Bob', 'Science', 70, 'Q2'),
    ('Charles', 'Maths', 70, 'Q1'),
    ('Charles', 'Maths', 75, 'Q2'),
    ('Charles', 'Science', 90, 'Q1'),
    ('Charles', 'Science', 85, 'Q2')
'''))

:::

## Pivot tables in SQL

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- Now let's pivot the table using the `CASE` function
- We will focus on the students' scores in Math and Science
- Let's calculate their average scores for each subject

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
df2 = pd.read_sql('''
SELECT 
    student_name,
    AVG(CASE WHEN subject = 'Maths' THEN score END) as Maths,
    AVG(CASE WHEN subject = 'Science' THEN score END) as Science,
    AVG(score) as total
FROM student_scores
GROUP BY student_name
ORDER BY total DESC;
''', connection)

df2
```
:::

## Pivot tables in SQL

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
- PostgreSQL also has a `crosstab` function that can be used to pivot tables
- It is a bit more complex than the `CASE` function, but it works fine
- The syntax is `crosstab(text, text)` and it requires the `tablefunc` extension
- We can install the extension with the command below

```{python}
#| echo: true
#} eval: true
connection.execute(text('CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;'))
connection.commit()

df3 = pd.read_sql('''
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ct;
SELECT student_name, Maths, Science, (Maths + Science)/2 as Total
FROM crosstab(
    'SELECT student_name, subject, AVG(score)
     FROM student_scores
     GROUP BY student_name, subject
     ORDER BY student_name, subject',
    'SELECT DISTINCT subject FROM student_scores ORDER BY subject'
) AS ct (
    student_name VARCHAR, Maths NUMERIC, Science NUMERIC
);
''', connection)

df3
```

## Pivot tables in SQL

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Let's break the code down 
- We first dropped the table `ct` if it already exists, just to avoid conflicts
  - `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ct;`
- We then used the `crosstab` function to pivot the table
  - `SELECT student_name, subject, AVG(score) FROM student_scores GROUP BY student_name, subject ORDER BY student_name, subject`
  - `SELECT DISTINCT subject FROM student_scores ORDER BY subject`
- We calculated the total score as the average of the scores in Maths and Science
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- The `crosstab` function requires two arguments
  - The first argument is the query to retrieve the data
  - The second argument is the query to retrieve the column names
- We then used the `AS` keyword to rename the columns and assigned the result to a new table called `ct`
  - `AS ct (student_name VARCHAR, Maths NUMERIC, Science NUMERIC)`
- And that's it! ü§ì

- SQL is cool, SQL + Python is even cooler! üòé
- We can use `psycopg2` and `sqlalchemy` to connect to a PostgreSQL database
- We can execute SQL commands with `execute()` and `fetchall()`
- Functions like `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `CASE`, and window functions are very useful
- There are also many string functions that can be used to manipulate text data
- We can fill missing values with `COALESCE` and pivot tables with the `CASE` function or the `crosstab` function
- And we can use `pandas` to read data from SQL queries and manipulate it

- Find all drivers whose names start with 'M'

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE driver_name LIKE 'M%';
''')).fetchall()
```

- Find drivers whose nationality contains exactly 7 characters

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE nationality LIKE '_______';
''')).fetchall()
```

- Or we can use the `LENGTH` function

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE LENGTH(nationality) = 7;
''')).fetchall()
```

## Appendix 01

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
- List drivers whose names start with either 'L' or 'M'

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE driver_name LIKE 'L%' OR driver_name LIKE 'M%';
''')).fetchall()
```

- Find drivers who have won between 10 and 50 races

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT * FROM drivers WHERE victories BETWEEN 1 AND 10;
''')).fetchall()
```

## Appendix 02 {#sec:appendix02}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Create a column called `rank_nationality` that ranks drivers based on the number of victories and their nationality

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT driver_name, nationality, victories,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY nationality ORDER BY victories DESC) AS rank_nationality
FROM drivers
WHERE victories IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY rank_nationality
''')).fetchall()
```

## Appendix 03 {#sec:appendix03}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Create a column called `driver_level` that classifies drivers as 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', or 'Expert' based on the number of victories
  - `Beginner` if victories < 10
  - `Intermediate` if victories between 10 and 50
  - `Expert` if victories > 50

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
SELECT driver_name, 
    CASE 
        WHEN victories < 10 THEN 'Beginner'
        WHEN victories BETWEEN 10 AND 100 THEN 'Intermediate'
        ELSE 'Expert'
    END AS driver_level
FROM drivers;
''')).fetchall()
```

## Appendix 04 {#sec:appendix04}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Create a new SQL table called `employees` with the following columns:
  - `employee_id` (serial, primary key)
  - `employee_name` (varchar(50))
  - `department` (varchar(50))
  - `salary` (int)
- Commit the changes
- Insert some data into the table and read it with `pandas` (you can see the example below)
- Use `pandas` to compute the average salary by department

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
connection.execute(text('''
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary INT
);
'''))

connection.execute(text('''
INSERT INTO employees (employee_name, department, salary)
VALUES 
    ('Alice', 'HR', 5000),
    ('Bob', 'IT', 6000),
    ('Charlie', 'HR', 7000),
    ('David', 'IT', 8000)
'''))

connection.commit()

# Read data with pandas
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM employees', connection)

# Compute average salary by department
pd.read_sql('SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department', connection)
```
