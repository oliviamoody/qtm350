# Lecture 13 - Python Data Types, Boolean Logic, and Control Structures

This material is based on the [Python Programming for Data Science book](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-programming-for-data-science/README.html), [Davi Moreira's lecture notes](https://davi-moreira.github.io/2024S_dsc_emory_qtm_350/lecture_material/material-topic-03/01-py-basics.html), and other sources. They were adapted for our purposes in the course. I would like to thank the authors for their work.
