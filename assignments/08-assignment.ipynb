    "# Assignment 08: Advanced Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will apply pandas techniques to analyse the `results.csv` dataset from Formula 1 races. Each question is designed to test your ability to manipulate and analyse data in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Loading**: Use `pd.read_csv()` to load the `results.csv` dataset. The data are [available as a `.csv` file](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm350/blob/main/assignments/results.csv) in the `assignments` folder or in the `08-assignment.zip` file in the `assignments` folder [in the course repository](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm350/blob/main/assignments/08-assignment.zip). Treat `\\\\N` as `NaN` when loading the data.\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning**: Ensure that all relevant columns are in the appropriate data types before performing analyses. Convert the `time` and `fastestLapTime` columns to `timedelta` data types, and the others to numeric data types if necessary (`to_numeric`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Filtering Top 5 Finishers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions to Use**: `query()`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Task**: Filter the DataFrame to include only drivers who finished in the top 5 positions (`position`). Return the resulting DataFrame with all relevant columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Handling Missing Race Times\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions to Use**: `to_timedelta()`, `fillna()` (search what `to_timedelta()` does)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Task**: Identify missing values in the `time` column and fill them with the median race time. Ensure that the `time` column remains in an appropriate data format after filling. Use the option `errors='coerce'` if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Total Points per Driver\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions to Use**: `groupby()`, `agg()`, `reset_index()`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Task**: Calculate the total points earned by each driver across all races. Return a DataFrame with columns `driverId` and `TotalPoints`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Constructors with Most Wins\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions to Use**: `query()`, `groupby()`, `agg()`, `reset_index()`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Task**: Determine which `constructorId` has the highest number of first-place finishes (`position == 1`). Return the `constructorId` along with the number of wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Average Fastest Lap Speed per Race\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions to Use**: `groupby()`, `agg()`, `reset_index()`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Task**: Calculate the average `fastestLapSpeed` for each `raceId`. Return a DataFrame with columns `raceId` and `AverageFastestLapSpeed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Top 3 Drivers by Average Position\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions to Use**: `groupby()`, `agg()`, `nsmallest()`, `reset_index()`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Task**: Identify the top 3 drivers with the lowest average `positionOrder` (indicating better performance). Return a DataFrame with columns: `driverId` and `AveragePosition`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Distribution of Starting Grid Positions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions to Use**: `plot()`, `hist()`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Task**: Create a histogram to visualise the distribution of `grid` positions from which drivers started the races. Customise the histogram with appropriate titles and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Identifying Consistent Finishers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions to Use**: `groupby()`, `filter()`, `unique()`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Task**: Identify drivers who have finished every race they entered (`statusId == 1`). Return a list of their `driverId`s. You may need to create a custom function to filter the data, such as `lambda x: (x['statusId'] == 1).all())`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Fastest Laps by Driver\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions to Use**: `groupby()`, `agg()`, `reset_index()`, `to_timedelta()`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Task**: For each driver, find the fastest `fastestLapTime` they have achieved. Return a DataFrame with columns: `driverId` and `FastestLapTime`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Correlation Between Grid Position and Final Position\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions to Use**: `dropna()`, `corr()`, `to_numeric()`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Task**: Compute the correlation coefficient between starting `grid` position and final `position`. Interpret the strength and direction of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus Question\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining GroupBy with Custom Aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions to Use**: `groupby()`, `agg()`, `reset_index()`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Task**: Group the data by `driverId` and `Year` (if available), then calculate:\n",
    "  - The number of races participated in.\n",
    "  - The total points earned.\n",
    "  - The best finishing position achieved.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Return a DataFrame with columns: `Driver`, `Year`, `RacesParticipated`, `TotalPoints`, and `BestPosition`.\n",
